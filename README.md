# CoreMLBats-model-calls
The sonogram images of calls used to train the CoreMLBats machine learning model

The images were all created using bcAnalyze 3 Pro Standalone. batcorder recordings (500 kHz samplerate) were used as input. Calls were manually selected and extracted. Use these to play around building your own model. Note if you use them, you are required per license to share your work freely as well.
